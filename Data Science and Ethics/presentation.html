						For example, there are less girls in computer science, so the algorithm might pick up that gender is a

						For this case, we might choose to remove the gender from the database entierely.

						But other biases are harder to unroot. For example, the influence of social classes, which is correlated to
						the kind of studies chosen, is also correlated to the high school.
