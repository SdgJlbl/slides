## How to edit

Jekyll is only used for serving the slides with Github Pages, Jekyll and Ruby should not be required unless debugging the website.

Reveal.js is used for the slides, it can be installed with node (cf `package-lock.json`).

Clone the repo locally, install node dependencies (`npm install` run at top level), and launch a local server with `python3 -m http.server` to see the local version.
