                    Debugging is a universal experience for anyone writing code.
                    It's often viewed as painful, confusing.
                    But it shouldn't be dark magic.

                <aside class="notes">
                    At least as long as we are not doing quantum programming, code is behaving rationally, and
                    there is a logical explanation to bugs.
                    We can use a systematic approach to find the cause.
                    We can borrow from the scientific method.

                <aside class="notes">
                    Debugging should be approached as an experimental science.
                    We can apply the same method as any scientist trying to understand what is happening.

                    It's also that the theory should be validated by experiments, and experiments are guided by the theory.

                <aside class="notes">
                    If you fix your bug by chance, you're not sure it won't happen again, you won't be able to build on
                    the previous fix to solve more complex cases, you can't transfer knowledge.
                    If you understand what happened, you're learning about your codebase and the idiosyncrasies of your
                    programming language. Debugging becomes an opportunity to learn, instead of a cause of despair.

                    We are not going to explain the whole of the universe, but focus on a small part we have control over,
                    namely your code. We are making assumptions about how the code is working, and what is happening during
                    the flow of execution.
                    Typically, we assume a few things, like Python is not buggy, the hardware is not hit by a rogue neutrino, ...
                    We'll come back to this, but applying Occam's razor, ie the simplest explanation is the most plausible,
                    is important.

                <aside class="notes">
                    If you have a bug / unexpected behaviour, at least one of your assumptions about how your code is working
                    is wrong.
                    Your experiments must help you confirm or infirm your hypotheses.

                    The theory is a mental image of your code. It's the analysis grid that helps you interpret your experiments.
                    You will use it to create hypotheses about what happened, consciously or not.
                    Do it consciously, to be able to challenge your assumptions.
                    Your experiments must help you confirm or infirm your hypotheses and your assumptions.

                    Experiments are what you get when confronting your theory to reality.
                    You get information about what happened, from your logs, your outputs, your stack trace, maybe
                    even your monitoring tools if you are lucky.

                    First, write all inputs and results of your experiments, to avoid going in circles.
                    Especially important if your experiments are slow.
                    Expliciting your theory is important, because you can better see blind spots: both assumption about
                    how your code works and hypotheses about what is happening during the bug.
                    Ideas you have, even random / stupid ones, as if you were brainstorming.

                    Default arguments are created once, when the function is defined.
                    If a default argument is changed during the function call, the new value will be used as default for subsequent calls.
                    It is recommended not to use mutable default arguments.
                    (Mutable == that can be modified, things like list and dict; immutable, tuples, strings and integers)

                    For the rest of the talk, I'd like to cover more practical advice on how to tackle a real bug,
                    when your code base is not 10-line long, but more like 100k lines.
                    How to build your theoretical view of your code, how to test your hypotheses efficiently, what tools
                    can help you for your experiments... and how you can leverage your debugging log to guide you through
                    your exploration.

                <aside class="notes">
                    First thing first, start your analysis with describing the bug: do you have a detailed description of the event?
                    Expected behaviour matters (cf in bug report).
                    Unsupported Python versions are not a bug.

                    Might seem daunting but it's okay not to list all the assumptions you are making, focus on the most obvious at first.
                    The ones that are most likely to be wrong, are probably the most interesting to test.
                    Start with simple explanations / assumptions, and move to more complex ones if needed.
                    Remember, it's a back and forth between theory and experiments.

                    Easier with experience, for codebase you know well, takes time to build.
                    Preexisting documentation can help you make sense of the code, but can be outdated or not covering
                    all edge cases.
                    Should be listed in your explicit assumptions: according to the documentation, X is true, and then
                    confirmed with an experiment.

                    Start from the input and follow the code flow by reading your code (modern IDE can help).
                    You can also use a debugger to follow the code flow.

                    Then, you can focus on one component at a time.

                <aside class="notes">
                    In parallel, you can start collecting experimental data points to guide your theory building.
                    Some people are more comfortable building an abstract view of the problem first;
                    others prefer to start from concrete logs and stack traces. Both approaches are valid, and you will
                    often use both alternatively in complex bugs.
                    Learn how to use a debugger. pdb might seem intimidating, and is not terribly user-friendly, but
                    it is useful.
                    As a team, invest in logging, and other monitoring tools.

                    Good monitoring solutions can help you gain some time, because it will narrow down your assumptions
                    and hypotheses without running any experiments.
                    If you have incidents in production, OOM killed machines, performance issues, it might be hard to
                    reproduce outside a production environment. Metrics will be helpful to identify chain failures /
                    temporary overload.

                    Most frustrating bugs are caused by a wrong "obvious" assumption that is not tested.

                    Sometimes randomness is out of our control (external API calls).
                    Sometimes, you can fix the random seed to help with debugging.
                    Sometimes, something is stateful when you thought you had no side effect.
